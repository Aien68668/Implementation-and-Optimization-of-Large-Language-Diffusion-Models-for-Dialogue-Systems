However, the sword will eventually come out of the stone.",
    "generated_answer": "If you see a sword stuck in a stone and pull it out, the sword will come out of the stone. This is because the force applied when pulling the sword will overcome the friction and separate the sword from the stone. The depth of the sword and the toughness of the stone will affect how much force is needed to pull it out. If the sword is deeply embedded in the stone, it may require more effort to pull it out. However, the sword will eventually come out of the stone.",

This conclusion was based on the analysis of the materials found at the site, which included materials that were not consistent with any known terrestrial materials.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Roswell incident}}",
